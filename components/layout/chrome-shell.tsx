/**
 * Decides the app chrome CLIENT-side so it stays correct across SOFT navigations.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the `(app)` layout is a SHARED layout — Next.js does NOT re-run
 * it on client-side navigation between routes it wraps (only the pages re-render).
 * So a server value the layout reads once (the middleware's `x-pathname` header)
 * goes STALE the moment you soft-navigate: the sidebar would stick to whatever
 * workspace you first landed on — showing on the hub, vanishing on a module — and
 * only "correct itself" on a full reload / HMR. `usePathname()` is reactive on the
 * client, so the show/hide decision here is always in sync with the current page.
 *
 * Rule: EVERY module — including WMS — uses the vertical left rail. Only the hub
 * and shared surfaces (which have no workspace) render without it. The `sidebar`
 * is server-rendered once and passed in; its inner nav (MainNav) + brand already
 * read `usePathname()`, so its contents track the current route too.
